# Pig-Latin

A Python program that translates an inputted string into Pig Latin. The rules of Pig Latin:

- If a word starts with a vowel, the Pig Latin translation appends 'yay' to the end of it (eg. "up" -> "upyay")
- If a word starts with a single consonant, the translation moves the consonant to the end of the word and appends "ay" (eg. "banana" -> "ananabay")
- If a word starts with two consonants, the translation moves both consonants to the end of the word and appends "ay" (eg. "slow" -> "owslay")
